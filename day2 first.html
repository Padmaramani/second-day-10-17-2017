<p> Pocahontas (born Matoaka, known as Amonute, c. 1596â€“1617) was a Native American[2][3][4] woman notable for her 
    association with the colonial settlement at Jamestown, Virginia. Pocahontas was the daughter of Powhatan, 
    the paramount chief[2] of a network of tributary tribal nations in the Tsenacommacah, 
    encompassing the Tidewater region of Virginia. In a well-known historical anecdote, 
    she is said to have saved the life of a captive of the Native Americans, the Englishman John Smith, 
    in 1607 by placing her head upon his own when her father raised his war club to execute him. 
    Some historians have suggested that this story, as told by Smith, is untrue.</p>
